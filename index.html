My main research interests are in social and political philosophy, feminism, critical theory, German philosophy, and history of political thought. <br><br>I did my undergraduate degree at Cambridge and a research masters at Birkbeck, both in Philosophy. In 2009-10 I was a Frank Knox Fellow at Harvard, where I studied German, Gender Studies, and Intellectual History as well as Philosophy. More recently, I was a DAAD Visiting Fellow at the Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt am Main (2017), translating texts in the Max Horkheimer archive. <br><br>I also have a Masters in Piano Performance from the Royal College of Music, which included an ERASMUS semester at the Universität der Künste, Berlin.<br><br>";
